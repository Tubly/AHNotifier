[Auction House Items to Monitor]
# Add a seperate section for each AH Item you want to check. Make sure to have it named like the following.
# The bracketed [AHItem#] must look like that with a unique number for each section.
# Get the Item ID from wowhead or TSM websites. 

# The price must be in COPPER! This is just to avoid any rounding and price matching errors. Conversion is easy!

# Gold: multiply the gold price by 10000. ie: 12g 70s 0c would become: 12.7 * 10000 = 127000 copper.
# Silver: multiply the silver price by 100. ie: 58s 0c would become: 58 * 100 = 5800

# Description: Friendly name. Can be whatever you want.
# ItemID: get this ID from wowhead or TSM for the item you want to check for.
# Price: The price to alert on - In COPPER! (multiple gold by 10000, or silver by 100 to get the price in copper)
# Check: Can be either 'Above' or 'Below' This is if you want to be alerted when the price is at or above/below the price you set.
